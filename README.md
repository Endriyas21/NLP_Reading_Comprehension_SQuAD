# NLP Reading Comprehension with SQuAD

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on reading comprehension using the SQuAD dataset. This project includes model training, evaluation, and visualizations for question-answering tasks.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) to train and evaluate a question-answering model. The model is based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and is fine-tuned for the task of reading comprehension.

## Features

- **Environment Setup**: Scripts to install required libraries and dependencies.
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Functions to load and preprocess the SQuAD dataset.
- **Question-Answering Pipeline**: Implementation of a question-answering pipeline using a pre-trained BERT model.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training the model on the SQuAD dataset and evaluating its performance.
- **Visualizations**: Visualizing the results, including confidence scores and answer distributions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Transformers
- Torch
- Datasets
- Accelerate
- Bitsandbytes
- Matplotlib
- WordCloud

## Example

```python
# Example of running the question-answering pipeline
from qa_pipeline import initialize_pipeline, run_example

qa_pipeline = initialize_pipeline()
context = "My name is John Doe and I live in New York."
question = "What is my name?"
result = run_example(qa_pipeline, context, question)
print(result)

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to help understand the model's performance:

- **Confidence Score**: Bar chart showing the confidence score of the answer.
- **Answer Length Distribution**: Histogram showing the distribution of answer lengths.
- **Answer Start Positions**: Scatter plot showing the start positions of answers in the context.
- **Word Clouds**: Word clouds for contexts, questions, and answers.

*Note: A Google Colab file has been added to the repository for easy experimentation.*
